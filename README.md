# Table Generator
In this project, you will generate an HTML table using only javascript. You start with two input fields that represent the number of columns and number of rows that will be generated. When the `Generate Tables` button is pressed, it will take the values from the two input fields and generate that size of table. Your final solution should allow you to continue to generate tables without refreshing the page. Make sure to add some content or specifying a height and width for each item in the table so that something is displayed.
